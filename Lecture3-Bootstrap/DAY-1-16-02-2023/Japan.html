          <p class="card-text">One of the most striking places to visit in Tokyo is the Tokyo Tower, perhaps the most recognizable structure in all of Japan. Although it is primarily a communications tower, visitors can climb to the summit to observe a panoramic view of Tokyo. The tower is also heavily inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris in its structure and architecture. The tower is a symbol of Japanese recovery after the Second World War and the fact that the country has now become a major economic superpower.
