        <aside class="aside1">With the rise of ChatGPT, you might be wondering, “Is this post written by a human?” Yes, it is. Call me old-fashioned, but I wanted to share a few thoughts about this rapidly changing space of AI-assisted content creation without giving the AI a chance to contribute.
            Swirling in my mind has been the persistent question, “What should we do?”
            ChatGPT is said to be a “version 3.5” of the GPT release cadence, and tech geeks following along are wondering how impressive, how useful, and how scary version 4 will be. I’m not an AI insider, so the release of DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, PaLM, Midjourney, SEER, Whisper, and GPT variants seemed to come out of nowhere. Experts might see this growth stage as just another incremental evolution in AI capabilities, but clearly, it has captured the world’s attention.
            So back to the question, “What should we do?” Or more specifically, “How should KANINI respond to increasingly powerful AIs?”</aside>
        <article class="article2">
            It’s a well-worn word, but at KANINI, it’s a deeply ingrained habit. We trust each other and our successes are a result of transparency and honesty. Our clients love that, and you will too.
            The timelines we set are realistic (we are always honest, remember), so we always deliver on time. This simplifies both work and life.
