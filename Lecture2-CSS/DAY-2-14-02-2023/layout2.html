He tells Code to eat the Chakra Fruit from God Tree after feeding either Kawaki or Boruto to the Ten-Tails, and become an Ōtsutsuki himself. Code vows to fulfil Isshiki's wish. Yurito takes Kawaki to Sai and Shikamaru, who confirms to them that the marks they found are Code's Claw Marks. Code makes his way to a still staffed facility from Boro's Ōtsutsuki Cult. Kawaki finds Boruto at the Hokage Rock, and admonishes for taking Amado's medicine. He tells Boruto about the Claw Marks, and warns him that Code is special among the Inners. At Boro's facility, the guards refuse to let Code in and attack him. Code uses his Claw Marks to evade and kill them. Kawaki explains Code's ability, and reveals to Boruto that Code acquired a Kāma despite being unable to become a vessel. More guards show up to attack Code, including one who injects himself with multiple enhancer syringes to become more powerful. He still fails to land a blow on Code.

        <h1>Heading-2</h1>
        <p>Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha clan. He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju, with the intention of beginning an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own plans. Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with Hashirama before his final death.</p>
