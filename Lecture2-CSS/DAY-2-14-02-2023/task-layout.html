        <article>p           <p>Spartacus (real name unknown) is a Thracian warrior who becomes a famous Gladiator in the Arena, later to build a legend upon himself during the Third Servile War. For the first season, he served as a gladiator in Batiatus' Ludus under the direction of Doctore and rivaled the then-Champion of Capua Crixus. Later, he and many of the gladiators broke free from captivity and began an armed rebellion against Rome.</p>
